# Class Management System - OOP in C#

## Introduction
This repository contains a Class Management System implemented in C# to demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project is designed to understand OOP principles through practical examples in the context of managing classes, students, and courses.

## Features
- Add and remove courses.
- Track student performance and grades.
- Use of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Concepts Covered
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes for Students, Courses, and Classes.
- **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers to protect data within classes.
- **Inheritance**: Creating derived classes to extend base class functionality.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing method overriding for dynamic behavior.
- **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes to define common behaviors for derived classes.
- **Interfaces**: Defining contracts for classes that implement specific functionality.
